# Species Prediction Model

A machine learning model for predicting species distribution based on geospatial and environmental data.

## Overview

This project uses data from the GeoCLEF dataset to build a predictive model for determining the likelihood of species presence in various geographical regions. The goal is to assist ecological research and environmental monitoring through automated predictions.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* matplotlib
* geopandas (if geospatial data is used)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. **Prepare your data** in the `data/` directory. Follow the format shown in the sample files.
2. **Preprocess** the data:

```bash
python src/preprocessing.py
```

3. **Train** the model:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

4. **Predict** using new data:

```bash
python src/predict.py --input data/new_observations.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Example Use Case

Use this model to:

* Predict bird or plant species in new geographical locations.
* Support environmental conservation efforts with predictive insights.
* Assist in biodiversity research.
